  <h2>Who Did This?</h2>
  <br/> 
  <p>
	The Git Reference site was put together by the GitHub team.
	<br/>
	----
	<br/>
	It's <a href="http://lanvige.com">Lanvige</a>, a git command user, 
	always forgot the command and the paramers, the common skills ware 
	not record in the best seller, such like #git clean#, I have to 
	create lots blogs to recored the common skills, but it difficulty 
	to search when you need it, the git ref give me a fresh when i first saw it.
	<br/>
	So I forked the project and binded to my domain, then put my skills 
	on it in the feature.
